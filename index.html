            <h3>VCET College</h3>
            <h5>100% placement as per college, but most of the students still not got job oppertunity.</h5>
            <p>The College (VCET) has come under fire after students reported a lack of job opportunities despite claims of a 100% placement rate. The college has allegedly been posting fake posters on social media suggesting that several companies have visited the campus and recruited students. However, students have reported that no companies have visited the college this year, and the posters are displaying data from previous years. The college administration has yet to respond to these allegations, and students are calling for a transparent explanation for the lack of job opportunities.</p>
            <p>Students of the College are expressing their frustration over the high fees they paid for admission, only to find that the education they received was not up to par with industry standards. Many students reported that despite their efforts, they were unable to secure placements with reputable companies. Instead, they were offered jobs in digital marketing and call centers, which they believe do not justify the high tuition fees they paid.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the college has been criticized for failing to provide students with the skills needed to succeed in the job market. Several CSE students have reported that they were not adequately trained in programming languages, and instead were taught outdated technologies. As a result, they are struggling to find suitable job opportunities in their field.</p>
                
               <p> Parents and students are calling for the college to provide better value for money and to ensure that their curriculum is relevant to the industry. They are also urging the college to provide better placement opportunities for their students.</p>

               <p>In a blow to the reputation of College, many students are coming forward to discourage others from enrolling in the institution. Several students cited a lack of infrastructure, outdated curriculum, and poor faculty as the reasons for their dissatisfaction. Additionally, many students expressed frustration over the college's inability to provide job opportunities after graduation.

                In light of these concerns, many current students are urging potential applicants to consider other options for their education. Some have even started social media campaigns to spread the word about their experiences at the college and to warn others against enrolling.
                
                While the college has yet to respond to these criticisms, some students are hopeful that their voices will be heard and that the administration will take steps to address their concerns. In the meantime, many are actively discouraging others from enrolling in the college in order to spare them the disappointment they themselves have experienced.</p>
            
            
            
             <h3>CBSE Date Sheet 2023: </h3>
            <h5>Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) date sheet 2023 for Classes 10 and 12 Board Examination is expected to be released soon. While many students are eagerly waiting for the same. The CBSE Date Sheet Class XII’ has gone viral on Whatsapp groups. But students are all curious to know whether the date sheet is fake or real?

But the answer to all this is FAKE. CBSE has not released the date sheet for either Class 10 or Class 12 Board exams 2023. With no official confirmation, students may note that the date sheet being circulated on Whatsapp is ‘fake’ and ‘not official’ and has warned of strict actions. The CBSE officials have clarified that the Date sheet has not been released as yet.</h5>
